# Computational Musicology Portfolio

### Research question: What features are important for classifying a song to a specific genre?

### Method
First, I will download spotify playlists for the genres jazz, hip hop,  and classical music and look at the features.
Then I might train a classifier that returns feature importance.

### First look at the data
Spotify playlists: Jazz Classics, Rock classics, Funk & Soul Classics

|   | Jazz  | Rock  | Funk & Soul |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Mean danceability   |   |   |   |
|Mean live   |   |   |   |
|Mean Energy   |   |   |   |
|Mean Loudness   |   |   |   |
|Mean Speechiness  |   |   |   |
|accousticness   |   |   |   |
